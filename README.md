## What is Telesto?

Telesto is a virtual world and a decentralized reserve currency protocol for a non-corporate controlled Metaverse that puts the health of the planet first. Each TELO token is backed by several assets (e.g. MC02, wCELO) in the Telesto treasury, giving it inherent value.  It is also of note that **1 MCO2 Token = 1 carbon credit** from a VCS certified environmental project (forestry, energy, biomass, etc.) through [Moss Earth](https://mco2token.moss.earth), making TELO inherently carbon negative. Also, because Telesto runs on top of Celo blockchain, which has been carbon negative for over 589 days (at the time of writing), this makes Telesto DAO an extremely environmentally-friendly organization with a non-inflationary currency (since it is not pegged to any stablecoins).&#x20;

## What is the point of Telesto?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system for the Metaverse, in which the behavior of the TELO token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that TELO can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency within and without the Metaverse while providing environmental benefits in the form of carbon negation.&#x20;

### How can I participate?

There are two main strategies for market participants: staking and bonding. Stakers stake their TELO tokens in return for more TELO tokens, while bonders provide LP or other tokens in exchange for discounted TELO tokens after a fixed vesting period.

Governance participants can get involved on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tcr3H97fnf), we are always looking for new community members to contribute!

### How can I benefit from Telesto? <a href="#how-can-i-benefit-from-olympus" id="how-can-i-benefit-from-olympus"></a>

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new TELO tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in TELO and thus the bonder's profit would depend on TELO price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static TELO price.

### Who created Telesto <a href="#who-created-olympus" id="who-created-olympus"></a>

Telesto was formed when Jupityr and Satyrn opted to become renegades in the fight against major centralized corporations having a monopoly on the Metaverse. We are working on a Metaverse that is free from corporate control and where major decisions are carried out by the DAO and the development team. It was also very important to us that their be a positive environmental impact to match the ethos of Telesto. The development team will be an expanding team from the DAO that posseses the skillsets necessary to contribute to the Metaverse's success.

### Who runs Telesto? <a href="#who-runs-olympus" id="who-runs-olympus"></a>

No one. Telesto is DAO-governed. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by token holders through snapshot voting.

## What is Telesto?

Telesto is a DAO for a multi-chain decentralized DigiWorld future that is censorship-resistant, teeming with experience, eco friendly, and community-first with its own financial protocol. We are looking beyond the current models towards a multiverse future that can have lasting and meaningful impact.

We believe that DigiWorldâ€™s should be owned by the DAO and that:

* Tools and libraries we use should be open source licensed
* Code should be visible on [Github](https://github.com/telestoworld) and is available for pull requests
* Developers should be accessible on [Discord](https://discord.com/telestodao)
* Major Development decisions are proposed and decided on via Governance
* Our platform is accessible for creators and artists and allows them to earn user-set royalties for their workâ€¦ including 3d assets, avatars, and other NFTs.
* Transparent collaboration occurs and development chat in Discord or other future chat mediums is accesible to the DAO and members of the server.

To improve on the use case of TELO we intend to bring utility to it for Telesto World. The protocol being the building blocks for gamified finance within Telesto World. Because TELO will follow ERC20 format it will be compatible with other EVM blockchains amd serve as a token used throughout the DigiWorld Multiverse.

### How can I participate?

Governance participants can get involved on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tcr3H97fnf).

### Who created Telesto? <a href="#who-created-olympus" id="who-created-olympus"></a>

Telesto was formed when Jupityr and Satyrn opted to become renegades in the fight against major centralized corporations having a monopoly on the Metaverse. We are working on a Metaverse that is free from corporate control and where major decisions are carried out by the DAO and the development team. It was also very important to us that their be a positive environmental impact to match the ethos of Telesto. The development team will be an expanding team from the DAO that posseses the skillsets necessary to contribute to the Metaverse's success.

### Who runs Telesto? <a href="#who-runs-olympus" id="who-runs-olympus"></a>

No one. Telesto is DAO-governed. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by token holders through snapshot voting.

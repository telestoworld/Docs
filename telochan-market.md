# üè™ TeloChan Market

#### TeloChan Marketplace will be an embedded feature of the treasury that serves as a front end exchange for 3d assets, Avatars, parcels of "Space", and NFT's. Artists, 3d modelers, VTubers, NFT fans, and Investors alike can buy, sell, and trade digital assets for use within and without the DigiWorld metaverse.

Some of these assets will have application within DigiWorlds (ie. space, wearables, avatars, props, nfts) while others may not. Creators will be able to set their own royalties for assets they mint, while assets like "space" from Telesto World will be decided by the DAO.

#### When TeloChan Marketplace is integrated into Telesto World, it will serve as the central hub for digital assets and space auctions in the DigiWorld metaverse.&#x20;

* Creators will be able to post their latest creations, or DigiWorld-ready Avatars (VRM format) to be bought and used by the people of Telesto.&#x20;
* Artists and collectors will be able to buy and sell NFT art and display it within their space in Telesto World (PNG, JPG, GIF, MP4)
* Builders will be able to buy and sell 3d models/assets for building within Telesto World (GLTF/GLB).
* Space auctions will enable access for Marketplace users to stake parcels of "space" in Telesto World. The space will continue to earn royalties and rewards will be distributed among space holders proportionately to their stake of space.
* The marketplace will be the foundation for the DigiWorld metaverse, the beginning of its own self-sustaining economy.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">We believe this will empower digital creators with a great opportunity to share, sell, and shape the future of Telesto and other DigiWorlds. The DigiWorld metaverse can only thrive when creator's are empowered.</mark>

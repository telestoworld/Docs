## Phase 0: Launch Sale

The Telesto Launch Sale on January 18th, 2022 will be the mechanism through which we provide initial liquidity and initial backing for the treasury and TELO. 30,000 TELO token will be minted for the event. Initial price of TELO token will be 1 MCO2/TELO for 600 unique addresses, with each address limited to 50 TELO to be paid for with CELO. The Launch Sale event will last for 48 hours. This will result in $340-360K (at current market prices) in MCO2 in total sales from the Launch Sale&#x20;

* The first $220K CELO will be used to bootstrap the liquidity and provide initial treasury backing for the TELO token.
  * $144K MCO2 will be paired with 12K TELO token on Ubeswap, establishing the initial extrinsic price of $12 MCO2 per TELO with initial liquidity of $288,000.
  * $76,000 MCO2 will be deposited to the treasury, backing the initial TELO supply.
  * This will be done within 24 hours after the LBE event.
  * We will announce the exact time when the initial liquidity will be added,z providing total transparency to our community.

<mark style="background-color:blue;">**What about the LP token?**</mark> <mark style="background-color:blue;"></mark><mark style="background-color:blue;">The $288K worth of LP token will be deposited to the treasury via a prolonged and controlled bonding process, with 1/100 a time across 267 epochs.</mark>
{% endhint %}

* If the launch sale exceeds $220K, we will use up to $140K to fund the development of Telesto Phase 1 & 2, including Telesto World. We believe this is essential for maintaining the health of the protocol in the interest of all participants in the DAO and Telesto community. Only the funds exceeding the initial $220K will be used for development. This means that if the total raised fund from Launch Sale is only $250K, $220K will be used for initial liquidity and treasury backing, and $30K will be used to support dev work.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;background-color:blue;">We are trying to be 100% clear and transparent with the people of the Telesto community. Olympus and Klima DAO's raised private rounds via pToken which works like an option but also dilutes the total share in the future. We are proposing a fixed rate round only to ensure the Telesto DAO can be sustained. Future development work can be funded via the Telesto DAO through a DAO snapshot voting procedure along with other major decisions.</mark>
{% endhint %}

We plan to launch the bonding function within 48 hours after the Launch Sale. We will target 12% discount positive ROI for bonders across the board for all pools. A total of 42k TELO tokens will be minted during the Launch Sale (30k for presale and 12k required to pair with MCO2 to initialize liquidity). If TELO tokens are not sold out during the Launch Sale, any remaining TELO tokens will be sent back to the Telesto DAO&#x20;

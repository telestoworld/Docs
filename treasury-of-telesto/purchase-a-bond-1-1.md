# Purchase A Bond (1, 1)

Bonds allow users to buy TELO from the protocol at a discount by trading it with liquidity (LP tokens) or other assets. The former is called liqudity bonds and the latter reserve bonds.

TELO tokens are vested linearly to the user over the bond period. Liquidity bonds help the protocol to accumulate and lock liquidity, while reserve bonds allow the protocol to grow its treasury, and thus its RFV faster.

**Bond Price** is the price of TELO you get from bonding. You can calculate the bond price using the following formulae:

* McUSD Bond: (Value of your McUSD token / TELO you'll get from bonding)
* DAI Bond: (Value of your DAI token / TELO you'll get from bonding)

**Market Price** is the market price of TELO

**You Will Get** tells you how many TELO you will get from bonding.

**Debt Ratio** measures the total amount of TELO created from bonds that have yet to be paid out by the protocol. The debt ratio is calculated differently for McUSD and DAI bond:

* McUSD Bond: (TELO created from unredeemed bonds / TELO total supply)
* DAI Bond: (TELO created from unredeemed bonds / TELO circulating supply)

**Vesting Term** measures the period a bond takes to fully redeem. This number is in CELO blocks.&#x20;

**Discount** is the difference between the bond price and the market price.

**Pending Rewards** is the amount of TELO you are entitled to receive from bonding.

**Claimable Rewards** is the amount of TELO that you can claim now. This amount keeps increasing as TELO is vested to you over the bonding period.

**Full Bond Maturation** refers to the Celo block when the bond is fully redeemable.

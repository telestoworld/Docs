# Stake Your TELO (3,3,3)

Staking allows you to earn TELO passively via compounding. By staking your TELO with Telesto DAO, you receive sTELO (staked TELO) in return at a 1:1 ratio. After that, your sTELO balance will increase automatically each 3 hours with the rewards.

**Your Balance** tells you how many unstaked TELO are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can stake.

**Your Staked Balance** tells you how many staked TELO are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can unstake.

**Next Rebase** tells you the remaining time until the next rebase.

**Reward Yield** tells you how much your sTELO balance will increase when the next epoch begins. For example, if you stake 100 TELO and the upcoming rebase is 0.5427%, your sTELO balance would increase from 100 to 100.5427.

**ROI (5-Day Rate)** estimates how much your sTELO balance will increase after 5 days, if the reward yield stays the same during this period. For example, if you stake 100 TELO and the rate is 8.4577%, your sTELO balance would increase from 100 to 108.4577 after 5 days.

# Bond Selections

As we head in the future, we will stay vigilant of the community and add new bonds accordingly. We already have several bond choices in mind that would be beneficial to the protocol, but we are intending to include the community through governance proposals and snapshot voting. &#x20;

Anyone can feel free to create a proposal for consideration by the DAO.

# DAO

The DAO is run by a multisig that is a 2 out of 4 approval. Since the team is currently comprised of 2 developers and several auxiliary members, the team will need to expand prior to allowing more signatures. We believe this to be the safest and most effective route at the current moment.

We are looking to add more members to the DAO multisignature wallet and are in the process of decentralizing to be truly autonomous. With this power comes great responsibility, and that is why we will not rush to make our decision. However, if you are interested in joining, do not hesistate to contact us: hello@telesto.world.&#x20;

You must ensure that there is absolutely no way that you will lose your private keys or access to your account as you would place the DAO in great danger. Consider this, and if you still feel confident afterwards, we would love to hear from you.

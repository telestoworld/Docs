# Stake Your TELO (3, 3)

5\.

On the _amount (uint256)_ field, fill in the amount of OHM you would like the staking contract to spend on your behalf, and multiply it by 1e9. Alternatively, you can use [this calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vm48OCBnVh8uah0-3Xa7HqFwmfxgcrMIWPrOllSFIvA/edit?usp=sharing) to perform the conversion for you. If you don't want to repeat this step whenever you want to stake, you can choose a very large value. Let's say you want to allow the contract to spend up to 1e9 OHM on your behalf, you would enter: **1000000000000000000**

## Phase 0: The DigiKey

![](.gitbook/assets/DigiKey.png)

DigiKeys NFTs will serve as the mechanism through which we provide initial liquidity and funding for the Telesto Protocols. All DigiKey NFT holders will be airdropped TELO in proportion to the amount of NFTS they hold when snapshots are taken after the collection sells out.

1,000 DigiKeys will be minted on[ Ethereum](https://telesto.money) and 1,000 on Aurora.&#x20;

The Initial mint price of .077 ETH per NFT to be paid for in ETH (ETH is also the base currency on Aurora although gas/tx's are much cheaper).&#x20;

Those that have already whitelisted will receive a 16% discount for a total of .055 ETH per NFT.&#x20;

We recommend [Rainbow Bridge](https://rainbowbridge.app) to bridge assets between ETHEREUM <> AURORA <> NEAR. Check out the[ "How To Guides"](broken-reference) section for some more information.

Transactions between Near and Aurora are near instant and very cheap, while you will have to pay a gas fee for going on and off Ethereum.

[Trisolaris](https://www.trisolaris.io/#/swap) is the highest volume exchange on Aurora and also has a Bridges section with options from Terra and other chains.

## Distribution of launch sale funds

84% of the funds generated from the launch sale will go directly into providing initial liquidity for to the Telesto Finance DAO, backing $TELO and starting the protocol.

14% will given to the development fund to start the immediate development of Telesto World.

2% will be given to Amazon Watch.

Amazon Watch fights the destruction of the Amazon, supports Indigenous rights, and finds climate justice solutions.&#x20;

It also happens to be [Lil Nas Xâ€™s charity of choice](https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1164346740041867264) for saving the Amazon.&#x20;

This will result in $833,280 for the Telesto Finance Protocol/$TELO , $138,880 to fund the development of Telesto World and $19,840 to Amazon Watch. To truly get this project off the ground and have the development of Telesto World DigiWorld Metaverse realized in a reasonable amount of time, we see this as the best course of action for investors, supporters and team alike.&#x20;

Anyone who has a NFT in their wallet will be eligible for their portion of TELO tokens. The amount of tokens distributed will be dynamically adjusted depending on market prices and depending on the amount of NFTs one is holding (maximum 5).&#x20;

We will airdrop all NFT holders their portion of TELO in the days following the snapshot and start the protocol shortly after. We wish to remain vague on the timing of the launch of the protocols in order to retain a competitive advantage and to ensure fairness (aka stealth launch). Whitelisters will be the first to be notified.

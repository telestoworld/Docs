# ðŸš€ DigiLaunch

## Phase 0: The DigiKey

DigiKeys will serve as a passport to not only the initial minting of TELO, but to Telesto itself. The minting price will also serve as the initial liquidity for Telesto Finance Genesis Pools.

600 DigiKeys will be minted with the Initial mint price of $500 to be paid for in Eth on Aurora.

Those that have already whitelisted will receive a 16% discount for a total of $420.

All mints must be paid for ETH on Aurora.&#x20;

We recommend [Rainbow Bridge](https://rainbowbridge.app) to bridge assets between NEAR <> ETHEREUM <> AURORA.

Transactions between Near and Aurora are near instant and very cheap, while you will have to pay a gas fee for going on and off ethereum.

[Trisolaris](https://www.trisolaris.io/#/swap) is the highest volume exchange on Aurora and also has a Bridges section with options from Terra and other chains.

## Distribution of launch sale funds

The launch sale if will result in approximately $290,000 if all DigiKeys are minted. This number is subject to change if less whitelisters show up for the sale, or the collection does not sell out.

If the launch sale generates less than $250,000, all ETH will be used to start genesis pools for the protocol on Aurora.

If the launch sale generates more than $250,000 that ETH will be given to the developer fund to start the immediate development of Telesto World.&#x20;

The initial minting of 30,000 TELO, as well as the launch of the protocol, is to occur before February 1st, 2022 and all DigiKey holders will be airdropped their portion of TELO.

\*IMPORTANT\*.&#x20;

**We will be taking a snapshot approximately 48 hours after the DigiKey minting goes live at 1/28/2022 UTC 0:00. This snapshot will determine who is eligible for the TELO airdrop.**

Anyone who has a NFT in their wallet will be eligible for their portion of TELO tokens. Since TELO is pegged to the price of NEAR at a 10:1 ratio, the amount of tokens distributed will be dynamically adjusted depending on market prices. For example, with current conditions would $400 worth of TELO would be approximately 259 TELO tokens since NEAR is currently at $15.42 USD and thus TELO would be pegged at $1.54.

We will airdrop all NFT holders their portion of TELO by Feburary 1st, 2022 from the treasury.

DigiKeys NFTs will serve as the mechanism through which we provide initial liquidity and funding for the Telesto Protocols. All DigiKey NFT holders will be airdropped TELO in proportion to the amount of NFTS they hold when snapshots are taken after the collection sells out.

1,000 DigiKeys will be minted on[ Ethereum](https://telesto.money) to begin with other DigiKeys being minted on other chains following (more details to be announced).

The Initial mint price of .077 ETH per NFT to be paid for in ETH (ETH is also the base currency on Aurora although gas/tx's are much cheaper).&#x20;

Those that have already whitelisted will receive a 16% discount for a total of .055 ETH per NFT.&#x20;

## Distribution of launch sale funds

84% of the funds generated from the launch sale will go directly into providing value for $TELO and  investors will be airdropped $TELO in proportion to the amount of NFT's that they hold (maximum 5).

14% will given to the development fund to start the immediate development of Telesto World.

2% will be given to Amazon Watch.

Amazon Watch fights the destruction of the Amazon, supports Indigenous rights, and finds climate justice solutions.&#x20;

To truly get this project off the ground and have the development of Telesto World DigiWorld Metaverse realized in a reasonable amount of time.

Anyone who has a NFT in their wallet will be eligible for their portion of TELO tokens. The amount of tokens distributed will be dynamically adjusted depending on market prices and depending on the amount of NFTs one is holding (maximum 5).&#x20;

# üåê Telesto World

In Telesto, we call the Metaverse "Digiworlds". This is to further differentiate ourselves from Zuckerberg's "Meta". Key differences include the lack of corporate control and having our digital currency backed by a carbon negative token (MC02).

We believe that the Metaverse should be owned by the DAO, with the major decisions and proposals carried out via governance. We believe the tools that we use for development should also be open source licensed (ie Godot).

Telesto World will initially support mobile and desktop browser and VR support within the months following. Some of the key features of Telesto World will include DigiWorld space ownership with royalties for all space holders, NFT support, P2E Games, Social Events, Gamified Finance & Governance, VRM support, Flying Cars, and more.

An important factor is our intention to establish relationships with other metaverses. We have already been whitelisted for space within Victoria VR to set up a Telesto Embassy. It is our intention to set up embassies in as many Metaverses as possible and to focus on interoperability between us and them, when and if possible.

A roadmap for Telesto World will be unveiled separetly from this documentation as it will require its own documentation.

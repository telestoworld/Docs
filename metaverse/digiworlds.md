# üåê Digiworlds

In Telesto World, we call the Metaverse "Digiworlds". This is to further differentiate ourselves from Zuckerberg's "Meta". Key differences include the lack of corporate control and having our digital currency backed by a carbon negative token (MC02).

We believe that the Metaverse should be owned by the DAO, with the major decisions and proposals carried out via governance.

Digiworld's main development stage begins soon as the Treasury is finished. We hope to have Digiworlds alpha build live by 2023 with VR support.

TELO will be used as a currency of exchange within the Digiworlds of Telesto, giving an advantage to all those that had been staking TELO during the period of development. TELO will have the ability to be exchanged for SPACE within a Digiworld so that user's can build and customize their own areas. We also plan on implementing in-world NFT markets, Play-2-Earn games, and much more.

Additionally, we will be issuing 12 founders key's to members of the DAO. These founder key NFT's will carry along with them traits and perks for Telesto World, namely: Free space, Avatar, and access to exclusive drops. We will be giving away 3 random founder key's to whitelisters. Only whitelisters who have submitted by 12/21 UTC 12:00 will be eligibile to receive a key. The remaining key's will be given away post launch.

A roadmap for Telesto World will be unveiled separetly from this documentation as it will require its own documentation.

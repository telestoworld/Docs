# üè™ TeloChan Market

TeloChan Marketplace will be an embedded feature of the treasury that serves as a front end exchange for 3d assets, Avatars, parcels of "Space", and NFT's. Artists, 3d modelers, VTubers, NFT Degens, and Investors alike can buy, sell, and trade digital assets for use within and without the DigiWorld metaverse. Some of these assets will have application within DigiWorlds (ie. space, wearables, avatars, props, nfts) while others may not.

When TeloChan Marketplace is integrated into Telesto World, it will serve as the central hub for digital assets and space auctions in the DigiWorld metaverse. Creators will be able to post their latest creations, or DigiWorld-ready Avatars to be bought and used by the people of Telesto. Artists and collectors will be able to buy and sell NFT art and display it within their space in Telesto World. For those interested in owning a piece of Telesto, there will be space auctions and parcels of "Space" available on TeloChan market which can be bought and sold. The space in Telesto world will also continue to earn royalties for all space holders similarly to how staked Telo sTELO earns rebase rewards.

We believe this will empower digital creators with a great opportunity to share, sell, and shape the future of Telesto and other DigiWorlds. The DigiWorld metaverse can only thrive when creator's are empowered.

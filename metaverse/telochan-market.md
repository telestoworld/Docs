# üè™ TeloChan Market

TeloChan Marketplace will be an embedded feature of the treasury that serves as a front end exchange for 3d assets, Avatars, and NFT's. A small fee from each sale will feed back into the Telesto treasury (1%) to keep the protocol and ecosystem healthy, but a larger royalty (0-50%) can be set by the creator who will also determine the price.

The TeloChan Marketplace will serve as a place where Artists, 3d modelers, VTubers, NFT Degens, and Investors alike can buy, sell, and trade digital assets.

The TeloChan Marketplace will eventually be integrated into Telesto World and serve as the central hub for digital assets in the DigiWorld metaverse.

We believe this will empower digital creators with a great opportunity to share, sell, and shape the future of Telesto and other DigiWorlds.

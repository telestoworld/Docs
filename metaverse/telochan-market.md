# üè™ TeloChan Market

TeloChan Marketplace will be an embedded feature of the treasury that serves as a front end exchange for 3d assets, Avatars, and NFT's. A small fee from each sale will feed back into the Telesto treasury (1%) to keep the protocol and ecosystem healthy, but a larger royalty (0-50%) can be set by the creator, who also determines the price (akin to the same way most NFT marketplaces operate).

The TeloChan Marketplace will serve as a place where Artists, 3d modelers, VTubers, NFT Degens, and Investors alike can buy, sell, and trade digital assets. Some of these assets will have application within DigiWorlds (ie. wearables, avatars, props, nfts) while others may not.

When TeloChan Marketplace is integrated into Telesto World, it will serve as the central hub for digital assets in the DigiWorld metaverse. Creators will be able to post their latest creations, or DigiWorld-ready Avatars to be bought and used by the people of Telesto. Artists and collectors will be able to buy and sell NFT art and display it within their space in Telesto World.&#x20;

We believe this will empower digital creators with a great opportunity to share, sell, and shape the future of Telesto and other DigiWorlds. The DigiWorld metaverse can only thrive when creator's are empowered.

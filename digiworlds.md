# Digiworlds

In Telesto, we call the Metaverse "Digiworlds".. this is to further differentiate ourselves from Zuckerberg's "Meta".&#x20;

We believe that the Metaverse should be owned by the DAO, with the major decisions and proposals carried out via governance. For now, proposals and governance will be conducted within Discord until a better voting system is developed.

Digiworld Development begins soon as the Treasury is finished. We hope to have Digiworlds alpha build live by 2023 with VR support.

TELO will be used as a currency of exchange within the Digiworlds of Telesto, giving an advantage to all those that had been staking TELO during the period of development.

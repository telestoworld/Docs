For sake of transparency, Telesto will respect the wishes of each individual developer and honor their wish to doxx or to remain anonymous. Thus, we will, for the time being, have a mixture of doxxed and undoxxed developers. I would ask the community to please respect the development team whether doxxed or undoxxed as this helps to create a virtuous feedback loop of community collaboration where future developers may feel comfortable in revealing their personal identity.&#x20;

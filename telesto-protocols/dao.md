### Functions of Telesto Finance DAO

The Dao fund is the second line of defense on top of the Scrap Mechanism. The DAO fund is controlled by the Developers and **will later move to a governance system** to vote on using funds in certain areas of the project and outside including investment, marketing etc.

Information about the DAO is as follows:

* When TELO TWAP is below 1, buybacks will be initiated by the DAO. These will be done at a time decided by the core team and not publicized until after the protocol is back in expansion to prevent front running.
* When TELO TWAP is extremely high, the DAO will sell some TELO to help assist bringing back to peg and prepare its reserves for buybacks below 1.
* The DAO fund will hold a range of assets at the discretion of the core team
* The fund may or may not invest in safe projects to earn yield and grow itself at the discretion of the team.

# ðŸ—º Telesto World DAO

Telesto World DAO, or the DAO that governs Telesto World, has its main HQ on Near protocol where votes are carried out in a democratic fashion and will serve as the main decision making platform for Telesto World.

[Telesto World DAO ](https://app.astrodao.com/dao/telesto.sputnik-dao.near)on Near is open for anyone with a Near wallet which you can grab [here](https://wallet.near.org).

Anyone with a Near wallet can submit proposals or send funds to the treasury, but only members can vote on proposals unless a proposal is submitted and passes to change this.

Votes are counted in 1:1 fashion where 1 person = 1 vote and proposals currently cost .1 Near.

&#x20;To become a member, you can submit a proposal or ask us within the [Discord](https://discord.gg/telestodao).

Once you become a member, you will be added to the "council" of the DAO. This will give you voting rights in the DAO and also unlock a channel in the Discord that is read-only for all non-council members called "the council".

This is a channel where members of Telesto DAO can have discussion and hold quorum over major Telesto World decisions.

Another discord channel "ello-guvnor" will also receive alerts whenever a new proposal is created.

## &#x20;TELO and how it is different

Unlike other stablecoins, (UST, for example) that are pegged to the US Dollar. $TELO is instead pegged to $NEAR token from Near Protocol.&#x20;

As many analysis show, the US Dollar is actually losing value over time. Pegging our token to the US dollar would be akin to creating a token that is equally as inflationary.

Instead, TELO is pegged to a cryptocurrency that we believe in, NEAR and the treasury runs atop Aurora an EVM shard of Near that supports solidity smart contracts.

Not only will this allow TELO to be ERC20 and multichain, it will allow our core team to expand on use cases for the token within Telesto World and/or other Metaverses, making TELO truly a currency for the metaverse that maintains its peg to Near while also retaining EVM support.



## Mineral



MINERAL is one way to measure the value of the Telesto Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain TELO close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints TELO and distributes it proportionally to all MINERAL holders who have staked their tokens in the Trident Lounge.

MINERAL holders have voting rights (governance) on proposals to improve the protocol and future use cases within the Telesto finance ecosystem.

MINERAL has a **maximum total supply of 70000** tokens distributed as follows:

1. _59500_ MINERAL are allocated for incentivizing Liquidity Providers in two shares pools for 12 months
2. _DAO Allocation: 5500_ MINERAL vested linearly 12 months
3. _Team Allocation: 5000_ MINERAL vested linearly over 12 months

## SCRAP

SCRAP's main job is to help incentivize changes in TELO supply during an epoch contraction period. When the TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of TELO falls below 1 NEAR,  SCRAP is issued and can be bought with TELO at the current price. Exchanging TELO for SCRAP burns TELO tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helping to get the price back up to 1 NEAR. These SCRAP's can be redeemed for TELO when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg. This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for TELO when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward 1 NEAR.

Contrary to early algorithmic protocols, SCRAP does not have expiration dates.&#x20;

All holders are able to redeem their SCRAP for TELO tokens as long as the Treasury has a positive TELO balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion periods.

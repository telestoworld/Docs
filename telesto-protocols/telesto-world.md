# üåê Telesto World

In Telesto, we use the term "Digiworlds".

This is to further distance ourselves from Zuckerberg's "Meta".&#x20;

We believe that Telesto World and any other DigiWorlds should be owned by the DAO, with the major decisions and proposals carried out via governance. We believe the tools that we use for development should also be open source licensed (Godot, Near, Aurora, Chainlink).

Some of the key features of Telesto World will include DigiWorld space ownership with royalties for all Space holders, NFT and specifically ERC-1155 support, P2E Games, Social Events, Gamified Finance & Governance, Gambling, VRM support, and Flying Cars.

An important factor is our intention to establish relationships with other Metaverses outside of Telesto. We have already been whitelisted for space within Victoria VR to set up a space to act as an embassy.&#x20;

It is our intention to set up embassies in as many Metaverses as possible and to focus on interoperability between us and them.&#x20;

The TELO token will serve a purpose here as a bridgeable token that can be used as a medium of exchange within the greater DigiWorld ecosystem.&#x20;

We intend to put the TELO token on many chains and exchanges as possible to offer liquidity and easy access in and out of Telesto domains.

Telesto World will initially support mobile and desktop browser and VR support within the months following.&#x20;
